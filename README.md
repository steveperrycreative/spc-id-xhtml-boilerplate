spc-id-xhtml-boilerplate
========================

Really stripped back XHTML setup with just jQuery and Modernizr installed.

I have created this for my own use really so it probably won't be much use to anyone else but feel free to use it if you do feel the need.

The only dependencies are jQuery and Modernizr.
